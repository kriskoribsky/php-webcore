# Webutils

Simple utility constants, functions and classes to use with other frameworks/implementations.  
The primary aim of this package is to provide integrity and reduce bug-prone hardcoding of
commonly used constants, while also providing methods for conversion and formatting.

Primary usage:

-   **Constants** for any PSR-7, PSR-15, PSR-17 and PSR-18 implementations.  
    Reffering to HTTP methods, status codes, messages and headers.
-   **Helpers** for some other PSR implementations.
-   **Integration** with frameworks, for example `kriskoribsky/webcore`.
-   **Bridge** between framework core and api services.

## Installation

`composer require kriskoribsky/webutils`

## Usage

Every utility is namespaced under the `Web\Utils` namespace.

## Documentation

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!  
With more resources we could create large, general,  
implementation-agnostic php repository of constants & utils.
